					<li><h4>Maximal Dimensions Of Uniform Sierpinski Fractals, <i>Fractals</i>, December 9, 2009</h4>
						<p>We studied the invariant fractals in convex N-gons given by N identical pure contractions at its vertices with non-overlapping images, which we called uniform Sierpinski fractals. We provided the explicit formulae for the maximal contraction ratio RN, and the maximal Hausdorff dimension hN, for the uniform Sierpinski fractals. We used maximal N-grams and principal crossing points as the main tools </p></li>
